		<h1>What are Realism tattoos?</h1>
		<p>Realism, also sometimes referred to as photorealism, is a term in the art world that refers to detailed and accurate representations of real-life imagery. Realism as we know it today originally came about in France in the 1850s as a response to the romantic art movement that preceded it. When realism is done right, it can sometimes be hard to tell the difference between a drawing or painting and a photograph.<br><br>Mastering this technique on paper is difficult in itself, but taking those same principals and applying them to skin is something artists spend years of dedicated practice to master! A realism tattoo done by an inexperienced artist or someone who hasn’t trained in that particular style can be a disaster, this is why it’s always a good idea to choose your tattoo artist wisely when dreaming up a hyper-realistic tattoo idea.</p>
