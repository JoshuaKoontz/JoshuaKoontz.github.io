		<h1>What are Blackwork tattoos?</h1>
		<p>Though tribal tattoos do make up a large portion of the Blackwork style, recently other aesthetics have been added to the roster as well. Dark Art, illustrative and graphic art, etching or engraving style, lettering and calligraphic scripts are all considered to be within the vein of Blackwork. In short, the style is a general term for tattoos that are made exclusively with black pigment.<br><br> Elements of this style of tattoo include thick outlines and bold, solid, black areas juxtaposed by intentional negative space or ‘skin-breaks’. Any design made up of solely black ink without the addition of color or grey shading can be classified as a Blackwork piece.</p>
